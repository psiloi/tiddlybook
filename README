TiddlyBook is an environment aimed at creating ebooks and pdf from a TiddlyWiki wiki file.

It is generating a docbook 5.0 file as an intermediary step. A sample project is included, with a Makefile for automattizing the process of creating the books.

TiddlyBook comprised the following files:
* get-tiddlers.pl : a perl script to extract tiddlers from a tiddlywiki file. Only TiddlyWiki classic is supported. The wiki file must be UTF-8 encoded. It generate a ruby file to be included by wiki2docbook.rb for later use.
* tiddler.rb : a ruby source containing the model for wiki and docbook, it's the core of TiddlyBook.
* tiddlerTest.rb : a ruby unit test for tiddler.rb.
* wiki2docbook.rb : a wiki program to generate the docbook. It loads the ruby file generated by get-tiddlers.pl and tiddler.rb.
* docbook2epub.sh : a bash script that uses the docbook to generate an epub. It is also using some graphics that have been made ready before.
* generate-schemas-makefile.pl : a perl script that generace a makefile to generate the graphics file for inclusion in the docbook in the format specified on the command line. Source graphics are inkscape svg file that should terminate in .inkscape.svg and target files are either svg or png files.
* Makefile : an exanple Makefile. Use the sample TiddlyWiki file in ../documents and the sample graphics in ../schemas. Please use the same setup as in the distribution to use this Makefile. Adaptations can be made at the beginninhg of the Makefiles with numerous variables.
